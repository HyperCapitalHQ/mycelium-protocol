## Resource
1. Most of them use CUs or SAAS model, but we use open source model.

## SAAS
Order the API and platform service and pay monthly.
Also they get a 10% or less service fee per transaction sponsorship.
and you should pay monthly or pay as your quotation using.

https://docs.pimlico.io/guides/pricing




## CUs
The logic is sell the computing service in cloud with their own service abilities like AA RPC and more.

Compute units are a measure of the total computational resources your apps are using on Alchemy. You can think of this as how you would pay Amazon for compute usage on AWS. Some queries are lightweight and fast to run (e.g., eth_blockNumber) and others can be more intense (e.g., large eth_getLogs queries). Each method is assigned a quantity of compute units, derived from global average durations of each method.

## Other model?
https://docs.stackup.fi/docs/transaction-fees

Stackup charges a flat 0.3% platform fee on most transactions. This fee applies to token transfers, swaps, and smart contract interactions.

Fee Exceptions
A few transactions have different fee structures:

ACH transfers: 0.7% total fee

Yield transactions: Percentage of yield generated
